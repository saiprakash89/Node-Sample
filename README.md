# Node Signed Request Sample

This is a sample Node Application which connects with Salesforce Org via a connected app that authenticates through a Signed Request.

Please look into the Procfile to start or you could start with app.js

I am using SLDS to style the EJB pages, and sf-tools helps in processing the incoming Signed Request.
